<h1>Terms & conditions for Boutiques</h1>

<p>LocalAway is a marketplace where you can sell your fashion directly to buyers around the world. We want to make sure that you and your buyers have a positive experience on LocalAway.</p>
<p>These terms and conditions (together with the information and policies contained in the "guidelines" pages on the website and any other documents referred in these terms and conditions) ("Terms and Conditions") set out the legal terms that apply to your use of our website http://www.localaway.com, any of its sub-domains and any other websites operated by us or on our behalf and any mobile device application or desktop application developed by us or on our behalf (together, the "Websites" and “Website” being a reference to any one of them) and the other services that we provide (the "Services").</p>
<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully and make sure that you understand them before using the Services. Please note that by using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not accept these Terms and Conditions, you will not be able to use the Services and you should leave the Website immediately. If you continue to use the Website or if you order products, we will take this as your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<h2>1) Understanding these Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms and Conditions, they have specific meanings (these are known as 'defined terms'). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of the Terms and Conditions where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).</p>
<p>When we refer to "we", "us" or "our", we mean LocalAway, Inc. Where we refer to "you" or "your" we mean you, the person using the Services.
We have used headings to help you understand these Terms and Conditions and to easily locate information. These Terms and Conditions are only available in the English language. We will not file copies of the contracts between us and you relating to our supply of the Services, or between you and the Partners relating to the sale of the products, so we recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms and Conditions for your records (but please note that we may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time so please check the Website regularly, and each time you use the Services to order products, to ensure you understand the legal terms which apply at that time).</p>
<h2>2) About us</h2>
<p>We are LocalAway, Inc. and we operate the Website. We are a company registered in Delaware and California and our registered office is at 800 Uccelli Drive, 8201, Redwood City, CA-94063. Our registered company’s EIN is 85-0617016 .</p>
<p>We provide the Services to you through the Website. When you purchase products using the Website, you are purchasing them from the third party retailers ("Partner(s)") named on the Website. It is important that you understand that the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. We are acting as agent on behalf of the Partners, which are the principals. You are not purchasing the products from us. We are authorized by the relevant Partners to conclude the contract on their behalf but we are not a party to that contract and you are not purchasing the products from us. </p>
<h2>3) Our services</h2>
<p>The Services we offer allow you to search through the Website and purchase personalized capsules & products from a large number of Partner boutiques and brands worldwide. As part of the Services, we also provide some ancillary services such in marketing, fulfillment and payment. However, as stated above, the contract for the purchase of the products is between you and the relevant Partner. This means that it is the Partner (not us) who is legally responsible for selling the products to you. </p>
<p>In order to use the Services you must be over 18 years of age.</p>
<p>To provide the best experience for sellers on LocalAway, we offer a LocalAway Seller Protection Policy package for a little extra peace of mind to eligible sellers.

<p>a) Ship your order according to the processing time or ship-by date you listed or as agreed upon through LocalAway Messages.</p>
<p>b) Ship the order to the address provided on LocalAway. If your buyer provides an alternate shipping address through Messages, be mindful of fraud or scams. You may choose to cancel and refund the order and ask the buyer to purchase the item again with the corrected shipping address.<p>

<h2>6) Privacy and Protecting Personal Information</h2>
<p>You are responsible for protecting members’ personal information you receive or process, and you must comply with all relevant legal requirements. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use LocalAway user information. These laws may require that you post and comply with your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to LocalAway users with whom you interact. Your privacy policy must be compatible with this policy and Localaway’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In particular, when you sell using our Services (subject to this Policy) or use LocalAway’s API, you may receive and determine what to do with certain personal information, such as when communicating with users and entering into transactions with buyers. This means you process personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and, to the extent you do so, under EU law, you are an independent controller of data relating to other users that you may have obtained through the Services. You are responsible for protecting user personal information you receive or process and complying with all relevant legal requirements when you use the Services. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use a user’s information. Such laws may require that you post, and comply with, your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to LocalAway users you interact with and compatible with this policy and LocalAway’s Terms of Use. For more information on the General Data Protection Regulation, see more resources at https://gdpr-info.eu and http://gdprandyou.ie. As a data controller (that is someone who decides what personal data is collected and the purpose you’ll use the data for) to the extent that you process user personal information outside of the Services, you may be required under applicable data protection and privacy laws to honor requests received from such users for data access, portability, correction, deletion, and objections to processing. Also, if you disclose personal information without the buyer’s proper consent, you are responsible for that unauthorized disclosure. This includes, for example, disclosures you make or unintentional data breaches. For example, you may receive a buyer’s email address or other information as a result of entering into a transaction with that buyer. This information may only be used for LocalAway-related communications or for LocalAway-facilitated transactions. You may not use this information for unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorized transactions. Without the buyer’s consent, and subject to other applicable LocalAway policies and laws, you may not add any LocalAway member to your email or physical mailing list, use that buyer’s identity for marketing, or obtain or retain any payment information. Please bear in mind that you're responsible for knowing the standard of consent required in any given instance. If LocalAway and you are found to be joint data controllers of personal information, and if LocalAway is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did in your capacity as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, you agree to indemnify LocalAway for the expenses it occurs in connection with your processing of buyer personal information.</p>
<h2>7) Creating and Uploading Content</h2>
As a member of LocalAway, you have the opportunity to create and upload a variety of content, like listings, Messages, text, photos, and videos. In order to keep our community safe and respectful, you agree that you will not upload content that is:

<p>If you are unable to complete a transaction, you must notify the buyer via LocalAway and cancel the transaction. If the buyer already submitted payment, you must issue a full refund. You are encouraged to keep proof of any refunds in the event a dispute arises.</p>
<p>Buyers in the European Union (EU) may be entitled to a 14-day “right of withdrawal” after receiving an item, during which they may return an item for any reason. The details of this right vary by EU member state. The right of withdrawal does not apply to custom items or certain perishable goods. Rights with respect to digital items vary by EU member state.</p>
<p>We ask buyers to contact sellers directly and attempt to resolve any outstanding issues before opening a case on LocalAway. For this reason, it is important that you fill out your shop policies and regularly respond to Messages from your buyers.</p>
<p>Buyers may file a case for a non-delivery or a not-as-described item. You must respond to any open cases within three days. LocalAway may request your assistance in resolving a case opened against your shop. LocalAway reserves the right to escalate a case early for circumstances such as seller inactivity, harassment, refusal of service, case manipulation, and undermining the integrity of the case system.
When a dispute is ineligible, we encourage both parties to work together to come to an amicable solution.</p>
